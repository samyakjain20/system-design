Here are the main design patterns used:

1. Singleton Pattern
    Class: ActivityLogger
    Purpose: To ensure that there is only one instance of ActivityLogger managing all the logs throughout the application.

2. Observer Pattern
    Class: User and ActivityLogger
    Purpose: The User class acts as the subject that notifies ActivityLogger of new activities, making the logger observe user activities.

3. Factory Method Pattern
    Class: ActivityLog
    Purpose: To create instances of ActivityLog objects. This pattern allows for the creation of logs without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
